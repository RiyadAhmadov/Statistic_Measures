## Introduction
Statistical measures play a crucial role in data analysis by providing insights into the distribution, central tendency, and variability of data. Understanding these measures is essential for making informed decisions and drawing meaningful conclusions from datasets.

## Key Statistical Measures

### 1. Mean (Average)
- **Mean:** The mean, often referred to as the average, is the sum of all data points divided by the number of data points. It represents the central value of a dataset.
   - Formula: \( \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} \)

### 2. Median
- **Median:** The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data points are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is a measure of central tendency that is less sensitive to outliers.

### 3. Mode
- **Mode:** The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal) or multiple modes (multimodal).

### 4. Range
- **Range:** The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a measure of the spread or variability of the data.
   - Formula: \( \text{Range} = \text{Max} - \text{Min} \)

### 5. Variance
- **Variance:** Variance measures how data points deviate from the mean. It quantifies the spread or dispersion of data.
   - Formula: \( \text{Variance} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \text{Mean})^2}{n} \)

### 6. Standard Deviation
- **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of data points from the mean and provides a standardized measure of dispersion.
   - Formula: \( \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\text{Variance}} \)

### 7. Quartiles and Interquartile Range (IQR)
- **Quartiles:** Quartiles divide a dataset into four equal parts, with the first quartile (Q1) representing the 25th percentile, the second quartile (Q2, also the median) representing the 50th percentile, and the third quartile (Q3) representing the 75th percentile.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) and measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

### 8. Skewness and Kurtosis
- **Skewness:** Skewness measures the asymmetry of the data distribution. Positive skewness indicates a right-skewed distribution, while negative skewness indicates a left-skewed distribution.
- **Kurtosis:** Kurtosis measures the shape and tail behavior of the distribution. High kurtosis indicates heavy tails and peakedness, while low kurtosis indicates light tails and flatness.

## Applications
Statistical measures are used in various fields and applications, including:
- Descriptive statistics to summarize data.
- Hypothesis testing to draw conclusions about populations.
- Quality control and process improvement.
- Risk assessment and finance.
- Data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
